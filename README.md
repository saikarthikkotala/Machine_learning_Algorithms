Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
This Repo is all about code and explanation of different ML algorithms for training various data sets.
And specials thanks to Ramachandra Rao sir for helping out!
